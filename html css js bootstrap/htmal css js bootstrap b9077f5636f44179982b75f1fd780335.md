# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This document will cover some basic information about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the foundation of every website, providing the structure of the page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to other pages or resources. HTML is easy to learn and is essential for anyone who wants to create web pages.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to add styling and formatting to HTML documents. It separates the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and modify. CSS allows you to change the appearance of your website, including colors, fonts, and layout, without changing the HTML code.

JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to create interactive forms, animations, and other dynamic features that make your website more engaging and user-friendly. JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development.

Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential for web development. There are many resources available online for learning these languages, including tutorials, courses, and documentation. With the right resources and a little practice, anyone can learn to create beautiful and functional websites.

In summary, HTML provides the structure of web pages, CSS adds styling and formatting, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior . Bootstrap is a framework that includes these languages and provides pre-designed templates for creating responsive websites. Together, these languages and frameworks form the foundation of modern web development

Bootstrap is a widely used front-end framework that is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a set of pre-designed templates and components that make it simple to create professional-looking websites without having to write a lot of custom code. Bootstrap is a great tool for both beginners and experienced developers who want to create high-quality websites quickly and easily.

One of the key benefits of Bootstrap is that it is responsive, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes. This is important because more and more people are accessing websites on mobile devices, and a responsive design ensures that your website looks good on any device.

Bootstrap also includes many built-in features that make it easy to add functionality to your website. For example, it includes a navigation bar, carousel, modal, and form controls. These features can be customized to fit the needs of your website.

If you are new to web development, Bootstrap is a great place to start. It is easy to learn and provides a solid foundation for building websites. If you are an experienced developer, Bootstrap can save you time and effort by providing pre-designed components that can be easily customized to fit your needs.

In summary, Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes pre-designed templates and components that make it easy to create professional-looking websites quickly and easily. Bootstrap is responsive, includes many built-in features, and is great for both beginners and experienced developers.

Breakpoints
Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.

Grid system
Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

Container
Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.
Container  which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
Container-{breakpoint}  which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint
Container-fluid  which is width: 100% at all breakpoints

Columns
Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment, ordering, and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system. Plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.
Alignment: Use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns.
Vertical alignment: Change the vertical alignment with any of the responsive align-items-* classes.
Horizontal alignment: Change the horizontal alignment with any of the responsive justify-content-* classes.
Column wrapping: If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.
Column breaks: Breaking columns to a new line in flexbox requires a small hack: add an element with width: 100% wherever you want to wrap your columns to a new line. Normally this is accomplished with multiple .rows, but not every implementation method can account for this.
